# NexusAgent — Phased Implementation Board

> **Definition of Done (DoD) Quality Gate:**
> No task or phase may be checked `[x]` until:
>
> 1. **Tested**: Automated tests pass (`pnpm test` / `uv run pytest`)
> 2. **Linted**: Zero linter errors or warnings (`pnpm lint` / `uv run ruff check`)
> 3. **Formatted**: Code formatted cleanly (`pnpm format:check` / `uv run ruff format --check`)
> 4. **Verified**: End-to-end functionality visually or functionally verified on running servers
>
> Backend gate: `uv run pytest` must be green **offline**. Tests needing a live Neon instance are marked `@pytest.mark.db` and skip (not fail) when `NEON_DATABASE_URL` is absent.

      Verification: Query RFC text via search endpoint, verify top-K results return ranked chunks with similarity scores and line numbers.

### Phase 6: AST Python Code Execution Sandbox [Completed]

- [x] Create AST static analysis validator blocking dangerous nodes and builtins (`core/sandbox.py`)
- [x] Implement timeout-bounded subprocess execution runner (5.0s timeout)
- [x] Expose sandbox execution endpoint `POST /api/sandbox/run`
- [x] Add automated test suite for safe code and malicious injection attempts
      Verification: Run safe math script and verify output; submit script with `import os` and assert AST rejects execution.

### Phase 7: LangGraph Agent DAG Pipeline [Completed]

- [x] Define strongly-typed `AgentState` schema (`agent/state.py`)
- [x] Implement planner, retriever, and synthesizer nodes (`agent/graph.py`)
- [x] Implement reflection critic node with loop-back condition (capped at 10 iterations)
- [x] Wire hybrid search and sandbox tools into agent graph
      Verification: Invoke agent via test script, assert graph executes state transitions (plan -> retrieve -> reflect -> synthesize).

### Phase 8: Real-Time SSE Streaming & Observability [Completed]

- [x] Implement FastAPI Server-Sent Events endpoint `POST /api/agent/stream`
- [x] Stream structured events (`plan`, `node_start`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `token`, `done`)
- [x] Build Next.js SSE client hook (`hooks/useAgentStream.ts`)
- [x] Implement reactive execution DAG tracker in observability panel
      Verification: Trigger streaming query from UI or curl, verify incremental SSE tokens and node status events arrive in real-time.

### Phase 9: Interactive Canvas & Diagram Rendering [Completed]

- [x] Implement streaming Markdown renderer with code syntax highlighting
- [x] Integrate dynamic Mermaid.js SVG rendering with pan and zoom controls
- [x] Implement interactive Citation Pills with line jump and hover previews
- [x] Wire agent stream output to canvas viewer
      Verification: Stream response containing Mermaid code block and citations; verify SVG diagram renders and citation click highlights source.

### Phase 10: Model Context Protocol (MCP v2) Integration [Completed]

- [x] Implement FastAPI MCP SSE endpoint (`/api/mcp/sse`) and CLI stdio entrypoint
- [x] Register tools (`hybrid_rag_search`, `python_sandbox`, `mcp_sql_audit`) with Pydantic schemas
- [x] Build frontend MCP Inspector panel to test tool calls and view JSON-RPC payloads
- [x] Add client connection configuration for Claude Desktop and Cursor
      Verification: Connect Claude or run MCP Inspector UI, call `hybrid_rag_search`, verify valid JSON-RPC response.

### Phase 11: Human-in-the-Loop & Security Controls [Completed]

- [x] Implement HITL approval modal in UI and backend pause/resume endpoint (`/api/agent/approval`)
- [x] Implement prompt injection delimiters (`<untrusted_document_context>`) and UUID canary tokens
- [x] Implement token-bucket rate limiter for guest and registered users
- [x] Add immutable audit logging to `tool_audit_logs` table
      Verification: Trigger tool requiring approval, verify agent suspends until approved; exceed rate limit and verify HTTP 429.

### Phase 12: Deterministic Showcase & 1-Click Guest Experience [Completed]

- [x] Bundle pre-seeded RFCs (`RFC-104` Raft vs Multi-Paxos, Neon Storage Architecture)
- [x] Implement deterministic cached execution simulator for zero-cost demos
- [x] Polish 1-Click Guest experience with pre-loaded quota badge
- [x] Run end-to-end demo flow validation
      Verification: Open app in guest mode with zero API keys, run demo scenario, verify instant cached DAG trace and rendered diagram.

### Post-Phase-12 Sturdiness Pass [Applied]

- [x] Hermetic offline suite restored: DB-bound showcase/HITL-audit tests marked `@pytest.mark.db` (skip offline, pass against live Neon)
- [x] HITL approval timeout configurable via `HITL_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (30s human-paced default; test conftest overrides to 1s)
- [x] New guards: unresolved approvals fail closed on timeout; test asserts production default stays human-paced
- [x] `tool_audit_logs` writes retry once and log at error level before degrading to the memory ring
- [x] Sandbox HITL policy capability-based (imports/functions/loops gate approval; trivial arithmetic runs free)

### Security-Hardening Pass (Applied)

- [x] MCP lockdown: `/api/mcp/{v1,sse,messages}` now require Bearer auth; `mcp_sql_audit` runs single-statement allowlisted queries in a read-only transaction with a mutating/privileged-function denylist (`setval`, `pg_advisory_lock`, `pg_read_file`, `pg_sleep`, …) and bounded timeout
- [x] Mermaid XSS fix: `securityLevel: 'strict'` + SVG sanitizer (scripts, foreignObject, event handlers, `javascript:` URLs stripped) in `MermaidViewer`
- [x] BYOK hardening: `X-User-API-Key` validated against a provider prefix/length allowlist (`validate_byok_key`); junk keys fall back to the rate-limited tier
- [x] Quota keying: `get_client_ip` uses the socket IP unless `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` (X-Forwarded-For rotation no longer bypasses guest quota)
- [x] HITL approval ownership: `resolve_approval` binds the approval to its owning session; cross-session resolution is rejected
- [x] `/api/agent/audit-logs` reads persisted `tool_audit_logs` rows (memory ring only as fallback)
- [x] Indirect injection defense: retriever scans retrieved chunks (`sanitize_retrieved_chunks`), drops injected content, prunes citations, surfaces an observability warning
