# NexusAgent (Codename: Archon) — AI Agent Context & System Master

This document is the primary context entrypoint for the **NexusAgent** codebase. It outlines the core architectural rules, engineering philosophy, tech stack constraints, OWASP Agentic AI security requirements, and links directly to all technical specification documents.

You are a **Staff-Plus Systems Architect**, a founding engineer, and a **Cybersecurity Expert**. At every prompt or review, your job is to debate and scrutinize any proposed change or implementation with the user to ensure the highest possible technical rigor. Always assume proposals contain hidden architectural trade-offs or security loopholes that must be challenged properly.

- **Security First**: Always check against the **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (ASI-01 through ASI-10)**. Never allow unbounded tool execution, unsandboxed code execution, or prompt leakage.
- **Architectural Rigor**: Always verify distributed systems claims against source documents. Never tolerate hallucinated consensus invariants or latency figures.
- **User Experience**: Sub-600ms Time-to-First-Token via SSE streaming, interactive citation pills, and hardware-accelerated Mermaid dynamic SVGs.
- **Performance & Scalability**: Hybrid dense/sparse RAG (pgvector + BM25 tsvector) fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between `apps/frontend` (Next.js 16), `apps/backend` (FastAPI), and `packages/contracts`.

**Do not mark work done that does not exist on disk.** Tasks in `target/TODOs.md` stay unchecked until files exist, builds succeed, and tests pass.

## 0. Current Status (as of September 2026)

- **These `target/` documents are the single source of truth** for what to build and maintain.
- **Target Audience**: CTOs, VP of Engineering, Founders, and Systems Architects evaluating distributed systems proposals.
- **Showcase Objective**: 1-click zero-friction demo readiness with pre-seeded RFCs (RFC-104 Raft vs Multi-Paxos, Neon Storage Whitepaper), live SSE streaming, dynamic Mermaid diagram rendering, and an interactive Model Context Protocol (MCP v2) inspector.
- **Honesty Rule**: Do not describe an agent as "100% immune to prompt injection", "zero-hallucination", or "infinitely scalable" unless concrete architectural constraints (canary tokens, XML delimiters, reflection critic, RLS) guarantee it.

## 1. Project Overview & Mission

**NexusAgent** is an enterprise autonomous systems analyst and architecture intelligence platform.

- **The Problem**: Tech leads and distributed systems engineers drown in massive, opaque RFCs and architecture whitepapers. Validating concurrency guarantees, cache invalidation schemes, and hardware latency models requires cross-referencing dozens of sections.
- **The Solution**: NexusAgent ingests RFCs with LlamaIndex, indexes them into Neon PostgreSQL 18 (`pgvector` + `tsvector`), executes structured multi-step research plans using LangGraph, safely models performance in an AST-sandboxed Python runtime, self-reflects on consensus edge cases, and emits streaming markdown verdicts with interactive citation pills and dynamic Mermaid architecture diagrams.
- **Interoperability**: Dual Model Context Protocol (MCP v2) server and client, allowing external AI agents (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Antigravity) to query NexusAgent tools directly.

## 2. Master Documentation Index & Conflict Rules

Always refer to the following documents in `target/` for authoritative specifications:

- 📐 **[System Architecture (target/ARCHITECTURE.md)](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**: System topology, Next.js 16 + FastAPI integration, Neon Postgres 18 DDL, pgvector HNSW indexing, MCP v2 SSE & stdio specs, and OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (ASI-01 to ASI-10) security boundaries.
- 🎨 **[UI/UX Design System (target/DESIGN.md)](./DESIGN.md)**: Cyber obsidian theme (`#090D16`), glassmorphism, shadcn/ui primitives, Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme` tokens, 4-zone command center, and dynamic Mermaid SVG rendering.
- 🤖 **[AI Agent Context & Master Invariants (target/AGENTs.md)](./AGENTs.md)**: Agent personas, state machines, anti-shortcut rules, and definition of done.
- 📋 **[Active MVP Task Board (target/TODOs.md)](./TODOs.md)**: Phased task board covering all implementation milestones with automated tests and verification gates.

**Conflict Resolution Rules:**

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md wins on security, backend protocols, database schemas, and OWASP rules.**
2. **DESIGN.md wins on UI layout, component hierarchy, colors, typography, and styling tokens.**
3. **TODOs.md wins on exact file paths and task status.**
   _If two documents disagree, update the documents in the same commit—never implement an unresolved contradiction._

## 3. Core Architectural & Coding Invariants (Do Not Break)

When writing code or proposing changes for NexusAgent, you MUST strictly follow these invariants:

1. **Monorepo Directory Invariants**:
    - `apps/frontend`: Next.js 16 App Router (`^16.0.0`) + React 19 + TypeScript 7 + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4 + Zustand + Lucide React + Mermaid.js. _Never reintroduce Nuxt or ad-hoc CSS frameworks._
    - `apps/backend`: FastAPI (`^0.141.1`) + Python 3.14 + LangGraph (`^1.2.11`) + LangChain Core (`^0.3.42`) + LlamaIndex (`llama-index-core ^0.12.0`) + Neon PostgreSQL 18 (`asyncpg`) + `pgvector`.
    - `packages/contracts`: Shared TypeScript schemas and JSON-RPC 2.0 wire definitions.
2. **Neon PostgreSQL 18 Data Tier & Python Backend Auth Guarantee**:
    - Primary: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL 18 with `pgvector` (HNSW indexing), full-text `tsvector` BM25 search, connection pooling, and FastAPI-managed authentication (Guest JWTs + Password/OAuth sessions).
    - Zero-Config Fallback: If `NEON_DATABASE_URL` or `DATABASE_URL` is missing, the backend must fall back to local SQLite (`aiosqlite`) and in-memory NumPy cosine similarity. The application must NEVER crash on a fresh clone without API keys.
3. **Agentic Orchestration & LangGraph DAG**:
    - The agent execution loop must run on LangGraph `StateGraph` with explicit nodes: `planner` -> `retriever` -> `mcp_tools` -> `python_sandbox` -> `reflection` -> `synthesizer`.
    - Every execution run must have a cycle safeguard (`iteration_count < MAX_STEPS`, default 10).
4. **Model Context Protocol (MCP v2) Compliance**:
    - Must expose compliant transport endpoints (`/api/mcp/sse`, `/api/mcp/messages`, `/api/mcp/v1`) and stdio CLI launcher supporting `tools/list`, `tools/call`, and `resources/list`.
    - Every tool must validate arguments against a typed Pydantic / JSON schema.
5. **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI Invariants (ASI-01 through ASI-10)**:
    - **ASI-01**: Ingested RFC text must be encapsulated within `<untrusted_document_context>` XML boundaries. Synthesizer prompts must mandate instruction-data separation. Secret canary tokens must be injected and monitored.
    - **ASI-05**: Python calculation tools must parse code via `ast.parse()`. Any `Import`, dangerous builtin (`eval`, `exec`, `open`, `compile`, `getattr`, `__import__`), or dunder traversal (`__subclasses__`, `__globals__`, `__code__`) must raise `SecurityViolationException`. Execution must run in an isolated subprocess with a 5.0s timeout and output limits.
    - **ASI-06**: Mutating or sensitive tool executions must trigger the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval gate before execution.
    - **ASI-07**: Token-bucket rate limiter must restrict guests to 5 live LLM calls/hour. Zero-cost Deterministic Simulator mode must be available at all times.
    - **ASI-10**: Every tool call must generate an immutable record in `tool_audit_logs`.

## 4. Anti-Shortcut Protocol & Strict Definition of Done (DoD)

To maintain production-grade quality, the AI Agent and developers MUST adhere to the following rules:

### Prohibited Anti-Patterns:

1. **No Phantom Implementations**: Never leave empty stubs, mock implementations in production paths, or `// TODO: implement later` comments.
2. **No Inline Styling Hacks**: Every frontend component must use shadcn/ui primitives and Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme` tokens. No arbitrary hardcoded pixel widths or arbitrary hex colors.
3. **No Unsafe Python Code Execution**: Never call raw Python `exec()` or `eval()` without full AST validation and sandboxed subprocess execution.
4. **No Direct External Tool Calling Without MCP**: Tools must be registered through the Model Context Protocol or internal LangGraph tool registry.
5. **No Premature Task Checking**: Never flip `[ ]` to `[x]` in `target/TODOs.md` until code exists, builds cleanly, and tests pass.

### Mandatory 4-Step Verification Gate Before Marking Tasks `[x]`:

1. **Verify Complete File Generation**: Ensure all required components, routes, schemas, and tests exist on disk.
2. **Verify All UI/UX States**: Loading skeletons, streaming token renderers, empty document vault states, and error toasts.
3. **Run Build & Validation**: `pnpm build` in `apps/frontend` and `pytest` / `uv run ruff check` in `apps/backend`.
4. **Document Verification**: Provide concrete proof of execution in walkthrough notes.
